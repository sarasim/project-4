# Project 4 - AngularJS Mars Colony App

## Project Summary
We built a one page app with AngularJS that reports alien encounters on Mars and the actions taken when the encounters occur. The app records the user information given on the check-in page, shows encounters from other reports, and offers the opportunity to file a new report that will then be included in history of encounters.

## Tools Used
- AngularJS, including:
	- Directives: ng-repeat, ng-click, ng-class, ng-animate
	- Modules: Controller, Directive
	- ui-router plug-ins
	- Ajax GET and POST requests
- CSS animations

## Experiences
Learning how to use the AngularJS framework has been a rewarding process, especially figuring out how Angular watches the DOM and applies changes through data-binding and $scope.  By its ability to manipulate the DOM dynamically, AngularJS provides us with a great toolset that I cannot wait to explore further.

Learning how to make cool animations both with CSS and Angular has been really interesting but I need to continue to refine these skills.
